# TimerBattler

TimerBattler is an Indie video game project with a brand new take on the Auto Battler genre, mixing mechanics from TFT, Underlords, Super Auto Pets, Slay the Spire and Battlegrounds.

**Pitch**

The focus of this project is making this genre a little more accessible to everyday players that may not have the amount of time that is required to play a long game session that is commonly associated with the genre. To make this possible, I have focused on a couple of key components that I think have room for improvement, while adding a mix of my own ideas, such as:

1. Making the duration of each combat, way quicker. Focusing on having multiple combats with a reduced scale(fewer units, with little health).
2. Allowing the user to take real time decision during the combat, this way the player is going to make use of a limited set of unique actions of his choosing to modify the outcome of the match.
3. A unique game mechanic to make combat faster, the Timer Mechanic, that makes the combat as slow or as fast as it is required by the player.
4. Mixing in some elements from the rouge-like genre (board modifiers and unique events), making each run an unique and special experience.

In this game, you can expect to see everything that comes into mind when talking about AutoBattlers: a board with cells to place your team, board units that level up by fusing with more units of the same type, a shop where you will be able to replenish and upgrade your team and a leveling system that allow the player to advance and buy better and more complex units in between combat. 

**Basic Idea**

In TimerBattler, the player will face diferent challenges across different levels where strategy, skill and a bit luck will be key to overcome combat and be victorious.

Short summary:

1. The player will start by selecting a Hero that will define the abilities it can use during combat that are unique depending on the selection
2. The player will go through different levels until the Final Boss is defeated or the player runs out of Units.
3. The player will go through combat during this levels, where strategy, unit placing and smart skill usage are expected.

Going into more detail:

Each level is a collection of waves of enemies, where you will have to manage a team of units in a board filled with enemies and diferent rules, battling until there are no enemies left, proceeding with the next round and repeating this process again and again. 

Inbetween waves, the player will find different events that are going to shake the experience, such as: some breather rounds to recover some health or some additional bounties the player can go to obtain better rewards, in between others.

The combat will be defined by the correct placement of units, how the player understands the challenge setted by the enemy unit's placement, the current board modifier and the smart use of the TIMER mechanic. *Continue explanation later*
